# Image Processing Assignment: Exploring Lena

This project is an exploration of various image processing techniques using Python, OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The project uses an image of Lena for demonstration.

## Features

- Image loading and display
- Color to grayscale and binary conversion
- Image downscaling
- Image analysis (mean, standard deviation, entropy, histogram)
- Contrast enhancement
- Image flipping and blurring
- Negative image creation
- Custom image cropping
- Histogram-based image search

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rasheed-Al-Qobbaj/Image-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Image-Analysis
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```
